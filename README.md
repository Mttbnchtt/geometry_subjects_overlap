Study adoption of geometric terms in non-geometric subjects.


Mathematical practice displays a somewhat unappreciated phenomenon. On the one hand, one regards mathematics as investigating (or purporting to be investigating) abstract entities and defining or discovering "more" or "highly" abstract structures and techniques. On the other hand, however, mathematicians often describe, refer to, or work with these items using terms that conspicuously bring to mind connections to concrete objects or situations. This happens, for example when they speak of a "_space_ of functions" and the "_distance_ between numbers". An interesting, popular type of "concreteness"-oriented expressions used in mathematics that I will call _geometrical representations_. By _geometric representation_, I mean an application of terms (like 'distance', 'space, and 'point'), whose primary applications are to geometric or spatial settings, to non-geometrical or non-spatial settings (like number-theory, algebra, analysis, and probability theory). I treat such issues at length in my dissertation _Geometric representations in mathematical problem-solving: Intuition and creativity_ (Department of Philosophy, University of Notre Dame, IN, USA; 2021). 

In this repository, as part of my interest in reasoning of an "hybrid" type, I study how percentage of words appearing in a geometry book also appear in a scientific book that belongs to another subject. The following table summarizes the results of the comparison. It provides the rounded average of how many words the column category shares with the index catgory. For example, the cell with index algebra and column geometry has value 24. This means that, on average, 24% of the words that appear in the index of a geometry book also appears in the index of an algebra book.
