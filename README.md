# geometry_subjects_overlap
Study adoption of geometric terms in non-geometric subjects.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Mathematical practice displays a somewhat unappreciated phenomenon. On the one hand, one regards mathematics as investigating (or purporting to be investigating) abstract entities and defining or discovering "more" or "highly" abstract structures and techniques. On the other hand, however, mathematicians often describe, refer to, or work with these items using terms that conspicuously bring to mind connections to concrete objects or situations. This happens, for example when they speak of a "_space_ of functions" and the "_distance_ between numbers". An interesting, popular type of "concreteness"-oriented expressions used in mathematics that I will call _geometrical representations_. By _geometric representation_, I mean an application of terms (like 'distance', 'space, and 'point'), whose primary applications are to geometric or spatial settings, to non-geometrical or non-spatial settings (like number-theory, algebra, analysis, and probability theory). I treat such issues at length in my dissertation _Geometric representations in mathematical problem-solving: Intuition and creativity_ (Department of Philosophy, University of Notre Dame, IN, USA; 2021). 

In this repository, as part of my interest in reasoning of an "hybrid" type, I study how percentage of words appearing in a geometry book also appear in a scientific book that belongs to another subject. The following table summarizes the results of the comparison. It provides the rounded average of how many words the column category shares with the index catgory. For example, the cell with index algebra and column geometry has value 24. This means that, on average, 24% of the words that appear in the index of a geometry book also appears in the index of an algebra book.

This analysis is surely imperfect (one could discuss the grouping of the texts, their selection, and many other things). Nevertheless, it is interesting to observe that words from number theory indexes appears most often in texts about other subjects. Geometry is a (somewhat distant) second when one considers other mathematical subjects and comes in the third place otherwise.

Though I will not elaborate here, concerning the roles of numbers and geometry in mathematics I want to remind the following passages:
1. "The integer numbers are the source of all mathematics" (H. Minkowski, _Diophantische Approximationen_, 1906 p. V)
2. "A characteristic feature of geometric concepts and methods is that they are based on _intuitive_ idas and [that they] preserve [these] advantages even though n an abstract [setting]" (A. D. Aleksandrov, _Mathematics. Its content, methods, and meaning_, 1963 pp. 162-3)
3. "This language [the language of geometry], with its 'spatial' connotations, has become so fundamenta ... that to dispense with it ... would be so awkward as to be almost impossible" (J. Dieudonn√©, _The universal domination of geometry_, in Two-Year Colege Mathematics Journal, Vol. 12, N. 4, 1981 p. 228)
